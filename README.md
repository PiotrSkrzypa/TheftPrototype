# Theft Prototype

A very quick (about 9 hours of work) prototype of a game about stealing objects and avoiding security cameras.

The goal of the game is to carry the yellow boxes out of the guarded area (beyond the walls) without being caught.

When the security camera spots a player, its light begins to change from green to red.

The player must hide before this happens.
